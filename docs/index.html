  <div id="Sustainability" class="tab-content">
    <h2>Sustainability</h2>
 <p>Hard facts:
    <br>   
- Animal agriculture is the leading cause of climate change
    <br>
   <br>
- The industry occupies a third of all arable land (If everyone adapted a vegan diet by 2050, we could sequester 772 GtCO2 which is the equivalent of 21 years of our current fossil fuel emissions)
    <br>
   <br>
- The average person only gets 18% of calories from animal products
    <br>
   <br>
- Water usage: A vegan uses on average a million liters less water than an omnivore per year. That is an equivolant to 30 years of 10 minute long daily showers.
   <br>
   <br>
- Methane has an instantenous GWP 124 times greater than that of CO2.
<br>
<br>
- Oceans store heat so immediate heating matters. 
<br>
<br>
- Coral reefs are vital for carbon sequestration, but they are dying due to overfishing and increased warmth. At a certain temperature the corals expel the algae (bleaching), they are in a symbiosis with and if it stays too warm they can't let the algae back and the reef dies.
<br>
<br>
- Honey bees are in direct competition for food with wild bees, which leads to a decrease of 48% of wild bee abundance around bee hive presence. Wild bees are much better pollinators than honey bees.

  <div id="Activism" class="tab-content">
    <h2>How to Activism</h2>
    <p>By going vegan and stopping to be responsible for their suffering you are already an activist in my eyes. But if you want to do more like me: Speak up about this topic, spread information as much as you can. It is a difficult fight, because our opponent is far more powerful. But people can change, it just takes one person to start a chain reaction <3
<br>
<br>
If you want to join some more organized groups I can recommend these ones. (Even though I strongly disagree with the way AV's leadership on how they handled the controversy of their refusal for transparency regarding money. I still think cubes are a great way to get into activism and over that initial fear of speaking to strangers.)

<div id="CognitiveDissonance" class="tab-content">

<h2>Cognitive Dissonance (A conflict of inconsistency)</h2>
<p>
Our brains have a natural tendency to seek internal coherence. When this consistency is challenged there are essentially 2 ways in which this contradiction is resolved. We either change our behaviour to sustainably reduce the discomfort caused by disharmony or hold onto our beliefs that don’t reflect reality and try to justify the behaviour in some way. For example a smoker who cares about their health might justify the act of smoking by downplaying the negative effects and or convincing themselves of the cigarette’s benefits (e.g. stress relief). Another example would be someone who is against animal abuse and needless suffering, but purchases animal products. The difference between this and the cigarette example is that you are directly responsible for someone else's suffering and death.
<br>
<br>
When you go into the supermarket and purchase for example a pack of cheese that is neatly wrapped and might even have a smiling cow on it you are being manipulated, because that is not the reality of the situation. Billa is actually running a campaign or „brand“ at the moment that states „Fair to the animal; animal welfare initiative“. This is nothing more than an attempt to keep people tractable and compliant, they are exploiting your cognitive dissonance („Ah I am glad I can consume meat, fish cheese, eggs and honey, what we do to them is fair after all“). The people behind this industry know the demand is shrinking and they are trying their very best to manipulate you into continuing to purchase their products. And even if they think what they are doing is right, what is it if not exploitation? "They are confined in a place they cannot escape, where something is being taken from their body against their will, ultimately their life as well."
<br>
How do you feel about knowing you can greatly reduce the suffering you cause? 
Please take a moment to ask yourself: If I was in their position, what would I want?

  <div id="Feminism" class="tab-content">
    <h2>Feminism</h2>
<p>'For anyone using the motto „My body my choice“ as part of their life philosophy, eating animal products is in complete contradiction of that philosophy.'</p>
 
<p> What is feminism?
<br>
Feminism is both a political movement and the life philosophy that women should have the same rights as men.
<br>
<br>
Why do we need feminism?
<br>
Today’s society is still heavily influenced by patriarchical opinions. The oppression of women can be seen worldwide: Unequal salaries with the same qualifications and in the same position, sexual violence¹, domestic violence that far too often leads to femicides and countless other examples that all share the same core issue, inequality. This fact reflects itself especially well in the governments of the world, they are still mostly controlled by men². 
<br>
<br>
What does feminism have to do with veganism?
<br>
Humans working in animal agriculture exploit the reproductive organ of female animals until they become "spent" (production decreases). 
For hens, it's their eggs that are taken, while for cows and other animals designated by humans as "farm animals", it's their milk. For anyone using the motto „My body my choice“ as part of their life philosophy, eating animal products is in complete contradiction of that philosophy. These animals are oppressed, they dont have a choice. You are responsible for their suffering.
<br>
<br>
Laying hens will never get to meet their mother, neither will they ever experience freedom. They have to live out their entire lifes either in cages or in overcrowded, stinking barns. Sicknesses and stress are present in all forms of exploitation, organic included. Laying hens were bred specifically to produce 30x more eggs than wild hens. This takes a huge toll on their bodies causing osteoporosis in over 86% of chickens³. As soon as their reproductive capabilities decline, they are killed.
<br>
<br>
Often a day after the calf’s birth, they are seperated from their mother. A milk substitute is forced down her throat and as soon she is pubescent she will be artifically inseminated. This is done by forcing an arm down her rectum to hold her cervix in place and then an AI-Gun with semen is put into her Vagina. Her child will then be ripped away from her like she was ripped away from her mother and is then connected to pumps. For 70% of cows this overproduction of milk leads to painfull udder edema⁴. Every year an arm is forced into her anus and her child taken from her with periods of painful milk production in between. After ~6 years she will be phsyically and mentally exhausted, she is now spent and subsequently killed. But who wouldn't be utterly exhausted after such an ordeal? All the farmers care about is their reproductive capabilities, including milk production. They aren't individuals to them, they are merely reproductive objects. Which is an issue women still face today, not being seen as individuals, but mere playthings of procreation. 
<br>
<br>
Let's fight for womens rights whilst fueling ourselves with nutrients that didnt come from the very oppression we are opposing.
